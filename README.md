ADDITIONAL PERMISSIONS

### 

Regarding the Symbolset Font:

This version of The Personal Page makes use of Symbolset (http://symbolset.com). 

Symbolsets are semantic symbol fonts. They work in modern browsers and anywhere OpenType features are supported.

The use of Symbolset's fonts is governed by their product license, which can be found here: http://symbolset.com/license/

If you intend to use Symbolset fonts in your own iteration of The Personal Page, you must purchase your own license from http://symbolset.com. They're quite affordable, and are well worth the money.

###

Regard the API Keys in the Code:

At various points in the various template files contained in this repository, my bit.ly API code is exposed. Typically, in cases where API keys were involved in code I would keep the repository private. But in this case, I wanted the code for my site to be publicly available without having to wipe it clean. So here we are.

You are not, under any circumstances, to use the code in this repository without first removing these API keys or replacing them with your own.
