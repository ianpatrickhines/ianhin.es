		<h2>About Ian</h2>
        </header>
        
        <p>Hello, my name is Ian Patrick Hines. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
        
        <p><img src="http://d.pr/i/4kCi+" alt="Photo: Ian Patrick Hines" /></p>
		
		<p>I’m a pretty lucky guy. I have a beautiful wife, named Christy, and two wonderful children. I have the good fortune of loving what I do. I have great parents, an awesome sister, and fantastic friends. My life has been good to me; I really can’t complain.</p>
		
		<p>I believe in the Holy Trinity. I believe the Divine Son became Man, that He died for our sins, and that He will come again to judge the living and the dead. I believe that these things, and all the teachings of the Holy Catholic Church, were revealed by God—who can neither deceive nor be deceived.</p>
		
		<p>I’m a bit of a political junkie. I believe that Public Service is an honor and a privilege. I believe that the measure of a persons life is the good that they have done, not the wealth they have accumulated. I believe that you must be the change that you wish to see in the world, and I try my hardest to act accordingly. I wear a ReminderBand with two phrases on it: (1) Life is about Focus & (2) Dream Big Dreams. I try to live by these phrases.</p>
		
		<p>I’m a brother in Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. I like to write. I dabble in photography. I have an unusual love for hazelnut coffee, cheese danishes, and British teas. I love music, and have amassed a collection of over 10,600 songs. I enjoy exploring new technology. I love the web. I enjoy a good conversation, and love to meet new people.</p>
